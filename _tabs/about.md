## About Me

Welcome! I'm a passionate technologist and lifelong learner with a love for creative problem-solving and innovation. My journey in technology began in the late '90s, exploring the frontiers of virtual reality, full-body interaction, and augmented reality. My first lines of code were written on a ZX Spectrum 48K, sparking a fascination that led me to earn a Computer Science degree from NOVA University Lisbon.

Over the years, I've developed expertise in C++ and C#, having used C# since its first public release, which has become my primary language. I am the creator and maintainer of several open-source projects under the [NetFabric](https://github.com/NetFabric) organization on GitHub. My contributions also extend to prominent projects such as [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) and [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity), where I've enjoyed collaborating with talented developers worldwide.

Currently, I'm working on generative AI (GenAI), exploring the latest advancements and their applications.

Beyond coding, I value balance in life. I cherish time spent with my family and recharge by riding dirt bikes on pump tracks or exploring mountain bike trails. These adventures fuel my creativity and keep me inspired.
